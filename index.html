   <article><i>A Brief History</i> &ensp; &ensp; &ensp; &ensp; &ensp; &ensp; &ensp; &ensp;

  

    <p>The fundamental concept of immunity from disease dates back at the minimum to 5th century BCE in Greece. Thycydides, the famous physician, wrote of people who had seemingly miraculously recovered from the plague which was then engulfing Athens. These people then became 'exempt' or 'immune'. However, the first organized attempt to induce immunity from a disease was in 
     tenth century China, where smallpox was endemic. This simple process was called "variolation" and involved adminstering material from disease wounds to healthy people, most often by inserting powedered scabs of smallpox lesions into the nose. Variolation was introduced into the realm of the Sublime Porte in 1670 by Circassian traders. The practice gained little acceptance
     as extremely severe side effects occassionally occurred due to lack of standardization. Variolation was later popularised in England, and spread rapidly through the British realms in the 1740s, particularly to the American colonies. <p/>
     
   <p>Today, Edward Jenner is often celebrated for his development of cowpox as an effective vaccine against smallpox. In the historical record, however, we find several indviduals who had achieved similar results earlier. In 1774, Benjamin Jesty, a farmer, innoculated his wife with the 'vaccinia' virus. In 1796, Edward Jenner innoculated James Phillips with material derived from a cowpox lesion
     formed on the hand of a dairymaid. In six weeks, the subject was exposed to smallpox, with no disease. Further experimentation by Jenner proved the efficiency and simple effectiveness of this method. When this feat became widely known, Jenner was summarily elected to every learned society in Europe and awarded a prize of 30,000 pounds sterling. 
   In 1875, Edward Koch, a provincial physician with no formal medical training, inoculated the ear of an animal with the blood of an animal which had died of anthrax. The rabbit died on the next day. By isolating the rabbit's lymph nodes, he was able to show that the bacteria within them could transfer disease to other animals. To that end, he developed techniques necessary for bacterial cultivation, most notably the agar growth medium.
   He was soon offerred a position at the Institute of Hygiene at Berlin, where he placed as his main goal the developement of a vaccine against the popularly-known 'white death' - tuberculosis. </p>
   
   <p>Meanwhile, now-renowned bacteriologist Louis Pasteur began his study of the 'chicken cholera bacillus'. In a discovery which only be described as miraculous, Pasteur, on accident, left a flask of his bacillus on a bench over the summer and inocultaed eight chickens with a viable, though aged, stock of chicken cholera bacillus. When he returned, he discovered that, not only did the chickens not die, but that no sign of disease could be seen at all!
  He immediately noticed the similarities between his 'pseudo-experiment' and Jenner's investigations. In Jenner's honor, Pasteur dubbed his treatment vaccination. Pasteur soon developed the first viable vaccines for anthrax and rabies. </p>
  
   <p>In the history of immunology, the relationship between Koch and Pasteur is perhaps that speck of dust in the grand scheme which attracts the attention of historians most. They were contemporaries, both strongly competitive, and, in fact, bitter enemies. This is due not only to science but also to the outbreak of the Franco-Prussian War of 1870. In a fantastic example of how <i>not</i> to behave at a symposium, Koch walked over to the podium after Pasteur's
   lecture and remarked: "<i>When I saw in the program that Monsieur Pasteur was to speak today...I attended the meeting eagerly, hoping to earn something new...I must confess that I have been disappointed, as there is nothing new in the speech which Monsieur Pasteur has just made...</i>". </p>
   <p>Most consider Pasteur the "father of immunology" (though many have quipped that "parent of immunology" might perhaps be more suitable), the 'germ' theory of disease was formalized due to the efforts of both himself and Koch. Prior to this, the practical effects of variolation were widely known, but no effort was successful in developing a solid scientific underpinning to their mechanism.
   By the turn of the 19th century, several major advances had been made in the field. The first was the 'germ theory of disease', which proved that disease was caused by bacteria. The second paradigm was the concept that immunity to disease could be transported by a soluble substance in the serum (Von Behring, Kitasoto), carried out by specialized cells of the immune system (Ehrlich), and that the maintenance of this process (by generation of antibodies) was crucial towards
   minimizing the possibility of an immune response against the self (Pasteur). Metchnikoff (a Russian), in his seminal paper, developed the idea that the immune system responds to pathogens by generating 'phagocytes', which consume the microbes by the process of 'phagocytosis. Notably, the very first Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine was awarded to von Behring for: "<i>his work on serum therapy, especially its application against
diphtheria, by which he has opened a new road in the domain of medical science and thereby
placed in the hands of the physician a victorious weapon against illness and deaths.</i>". Ehrlich and and Metchnikoff, for "<i>their work on immunity</i> shared the Nobel Prize in 1908. <p/>
<p> After that, science, as is its wont, began to multiply its discoveries exponentially. Research in the field accelerated at a magnificent pace, and the amount of 'names' which we can bring up widens significantly. Through studies of tumor grafts in mice, which appeared to accepted between inbred mice, but not those of genetic divergence, led to the discovery of the <i> major histocompatability complex</i>, crucial for the emerging science of organ transplantation. Further details were discovered later in the century, culminating in Polly Matzinger's 1989 <i> danger theory </i>, which demonstrates how the immune system senses
danger as a consquence of infection. Proteins from necrotic cells were shown to stimulate antigen-presenting cells!
