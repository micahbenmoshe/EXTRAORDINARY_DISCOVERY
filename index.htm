   <article><i>Vaccination: An Extraordinary Step for Humankind</i> &ensp; &ensp;

   The fundamental concept of immunity from disease dates back at the minimum to 5th century BCE in Greece. Thycydides, the famous physician, wrote of people who had seemingly miraculously recovered from the plague which was then engulfing Athens. These people then became 'exempt' or 'immune'. However, the first organized attempt to induce immunity from a disease was in 
     tenth century China, where smallpox was endemic. This simple process was called "variolation" and involved adminstering material from disease wounds to healthy people, most often by inserting powedered scabs of smallpox lesions into the nose. Variolation was introduced into the realm of the Sublime Porte in 1670 by Circassian traders. The practice gained little acceptance
     as extremely severe side effects occassionally occurred due to lack of standardization. Variolation was later popularised in England, and spread rapidly through the British realms in the 1740s, particularly to the American colonies. 
     
   Today, Edward Jenner is often celebrated for his development of cowpox as an effective vaccine against smallpox. In the historical record, however, we find several indviduals who had achieved similar results earlier. In 1774, Benjamin Jesty, a farmer, innoculated his wife with the 'vaccinia' virus. In 1796, Edward Jenner innoculated James Phillips with material derived from a cowpox lesion
     formed on the hand of a dairymaid. In six weeks, the subject was exposed to smallpox, with no disease. Further experimentation by Jenner proved the efficiency and simple effectiveness of this method. When this feat became widely known, Jenner was summarily elected to every learned society in Europe and awarded a prize of 30,000 pounds sterling.
